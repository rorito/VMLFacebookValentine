			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/rando_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/rando_over.png"/><span>Hey random person. Whoever you are, you sure like my posts. And I like that. I could write "Stalker Alert" and you'd probably give it a double thumbs-up. Keep it up stranger (but stop going through my trash). Happy Valentine's Day!</span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/co_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/co_over.png"/><span>It’s true, you ‘like’ my posts more than you like complaining about timesheets. Which is a lot, I can tell you. Congratulations on some outstanding non-work work compadre. Happy Valentine’s Day!</span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/social_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/social_over.png"/><span>Course, you’re probably everyone’s. Even your own. I heard they shut down Facebook once because you “over-liked the internet.” Well bring on the techno love-orgy Social Suzy! Happy Valentines Day!</span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/fam_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/fam_over.png"/><span>We share DNA. You share all my posts. Yay. Good to know my family’s keeping an eye on me. A lot. Got to go change my privacy settings now. Happy Valentine’s Day! </span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/bff_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/bff_over.png"/><span>LOL!!! OMG!!! You’ve liked, like, all my posts the most out of everyone!!! Shocker!! Hey, you know that really funny post we always reference on each other’s walls? Yeah? Me too!! Isn’t it awesome! HVD BFF! Xoxo</span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/ex_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/ex_over.png"/><span>So, this is awk-weird. Turns out you’ve liked my posts more than anyone else. Cute, if we were still together. Not so much now. I think it may be time to move on. Digitally. And can I have my CDs back? </span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/sig_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/sig_over.png"/><span>Phew! I was afraid it was going to be that weird mouth-breather from high school who only spoke in iambic pentameter. He “likes” me a lot on Facebook, but not as much as you do. Happy Valentines Day!</span></li>
			<li><img class="up" src="img/btn/anyone_up.png"/><img class="over" src="img/btn/anyone_over.png"/><span>And all you had to do was ‘like’ my posts more than anyone else! Well, here’s to you, my online advocate! Keep giving me the big thumbs up, and have a Happy Valentine’s Day!</span></li>
